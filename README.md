# decimal-to-css-ascii

Tiny script to convert a decimal code to an ascii string... 
This could be used for the value of the css property `content`.

## Install

`npm install decimal-to-css-ascii`

## Usage

```javascript
var codeToAscii = require('decimal-to-css-ascii');
console.log(codeToAscii(59392));
```

## Use case

For some of my websites, I use the icon fonts generator [Fontello](http://fontello.com/)...
The zip archive that I can download from Fontello, comes with fonts files, css and `config.json` which describes the font I generated.

The generated `css` files look like:

```css
...
.ico-music:before { content: '\e800'; }
...
```

That's nice.. 

But I'd like to use Sass variables instead of `'\e800'` because:

  - It is not really human friendly once you get to it in your css declarations
  - Adding/removing icons later in time could change the affected character ranges and break icons !

I want to generate a `scss` file defining Sass variables instead, something like:

```scss
...
// All icons variables from fontello are defined inside this file: `_ico-vars.scss`
$ico-music: '\e800';
...
```

```
...
// Another scss file
@import "ico_vars";
.some-btn:before { content: $ico-music; }
...
```

In order to do so, I use a script written in node that will parse the `config.json` file and export a `scss` file from it.

Here are few lines from `config.json` generated by Fontello:

```
  "glyphs": [
    {
      "uid": "a6fa1de9a1c1b0d9d58cc4cde6dcf17c",
      "css": "music",
      "code": 59392,
      "src": "custom_icons",
      "selected": true,
      "svg": {
        "path": "M857.1 (...) 125Z",
        "width": 857.1428571428571
      },
      "search": [
        "music",
        "note",
        "song",
        "sound"
      ]
    },
```

See the `code` property ? This is the value that must be converted into ascii value (from `59392` to `\e800`), and this is where I use `decimal-to-css-ascii`...
